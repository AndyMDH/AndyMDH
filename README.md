### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Andy.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Springer Nature AI Lab.

I'm originally from Canada and I've lived in Vietnam, the UK, and the Netherlands.

âš¡In my spare time, you can catch me developing personal projects, cycling around Amsterdam, playing squash, exploring countries, cooking new food recipes, but always learning new things.
